If you're new to IT or just want to get your PC running smoother, this one’s for you.

When I first started learning about tech, I kind of brushed off Windows. I was more excited about Linux — the free, open-source stuff that makes you feel like a real hacker. But after working on a few systems and studying for my CompTIA A+, I realized that Windows is everywhere. And if you want to be helpful to real users (or even your own family), Windows is where the action is.

Let’s go over five tools and tricks built right into Windows that I use all the time.

## 1. Task Manager: Your First Stop for “Why Is My PC So Slow?”

When your system feels like it's dragging — apps freezing, fans whirring, mouse stuttering — Task Manager is the first place I look. You can open it with `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` or just right-click the taskbar.

Start with the **Processes** tab. Sort by CPU or Memory to see what’s hogging your resources. If an app freezes up, right-click it and select “End Task.” Simple fix.

**Performance** is great for visuals — you’ll see your CPU, RAM, and network usage in real time. I once downloaded a sketchy Linux ISO and wondered why my laptop started sounding like it was taking off. Turned out the CPU was getting hammered. Task Manager helped me piece it together.

If you're curious about real-time stats (especially if you're running things like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search)), keep Performance open and watch your CPU max out.

**Other tabs worth knowing**:
- **Users**: See who’s logged in and what they’re using.
- **Details**: Dive deep into what’s running, process IDs, and memory usage.
- **Services**: View and manage background Windows tasks.

## 2. Device Manager: When Your Hardware Acts Up

This is where I go when USB devices don’t show up, audio stops working, or Bluetooth disappears.

Open it by searching “Device Manager” or running `devmgmt.msc`.

Real story: My little brother synced his Meta Quest headset to my mom’s PC. It hijacked all the audio inputs, and she couldn’t hear anything during an interview. I uninstalled the Meta drivers from Device Manager — but it also removed the real audio drivers. Not fun. I had to go into Control Panel to re-enable everything and get her PC talking again.

If something’s not showing up, go to **Action > Scan for hardware changes** to refresh it. Here’s a helpful link to [Microsoft’s Device Manager documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-device-manager).

## 3. Disk Cleanup: Clean House

Temporary files, update leftovers, and browser cache all pile up over time. Disk Cleanup is an easy way to free space.

Run `cleanmgr` from the Run box (`Win + R`) or the Command Prompt. Pick your main drive, check everything you want to clear (Temp files, Recycle Bin, etc.), then click OK.

Want deeper cleaning? Run it as an admin.

## 4. System Restore: Undo a Bad Update

Ever installed a Windows update and suddenly your PC refuses to boot right or apps stop working? Been there.

System Restore lets you roll back your system without touching your personal files. Just search “System Restore,” click “Create a restore point,” and follow the prompts.

Pick a date before the problem started and let Windows do its thing. You’ll keep your documents, but it might remove apps installed after that point.

Here’s the official guide if you want to dive deeper: [Microsoft System Restore](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-system-restore-to-recover-your-pc-0d3e9708-4e5e-4c1e-9f9e-8e6d8f7e8f8d)

## 5. Networking Issues? Let’s Talk IPConfig

You’ve probably seen it — the “No Internet” icon with the globe and slash. That’s when I go to **Command Prompt**.

Open CMD as admin, then try these:

```bash
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
These commands reset your IP lease, which is helpful if your router’s giving out duplicate addresses or the system can’t find one.

Still no luck? Try fixing DNS:

bash
Copy code
ipconfig /flushdns
ipconfig /registerdns
These will clear cached DNS entries and get your browser connecting again.

If that fails, you can also:

Forget your Wi-Fi network and reconnect

Go to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections

Disable and re-enable your network adapter

Hopefully that gives you a good foundation. If you’re just starting out in IT or prepping for your A+ cert, knowing these tools inside and out will set you apart. And if you're just trying to make your PC run a little better — welcome to the club.

If this helped, share it, bookmark it, or drop me a message. I’m still learning too — but every day I figure something new out, I try to write it down.

Happy learning.
