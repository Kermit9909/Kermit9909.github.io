So, Microsoft’s finally pulling the plug on the Remote Desktop app — and honestly, it’s about time.

On **May 27, 2025**, they’re officially retiring the old RD app and pushing everyone over to their new platform: **the Windows App**. If you’re working in IT, especially support or systems admin roles, this is something you’ll want to be familiar with.

## What's the Windows App?

Think of it as the Remote Desktop app... but modernized.

Microsoft’s building this to support **Windows 365**, **Azure Virtual Desktop**, **Dev Box**, and other cloud services — all in one interface. Instead of juggling different apps for different services, the Windows App brings everything together.

It works on **Windows, Mac, iOS, iPadOS**, and even directly in a **web browser**. That’s a huge plus if you’re in a hybrid environment or helping users on multiple platforms.

## Why They're Killing Off Remote Desktop

The old RD app worked fine for traditional RDP sessions, but it’s lagging behind in today’s cloud-first setups. Microsoft wants something more integrated — especially now that **cloud PCs**, **virtual desktops**, and **developer environments** are becoming standard in enterprise settings.

This new app also plays nicer with **Microsoft Teams**, which should reduce some of those annoying performance issues when working remotely.

## How To Try It

Getting started is easy:

1. Grab it from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/windows-app/9nblggh4nns1) or the app store for your platform.
2. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account.
3. Connect to your Windows 365 machine, AVD setup, or whatever resource your org uses.

That’s it. You’re in.

## Pros & Cons (Based on Real-World Use)

### What’s Good
- Everything is in one app now — no more juggling different tools.
- Teams runs smoother.
- It has a clean, modern UI — dark mode, multi-monitor, profiles.
- You can use it on any device, even in a browser.

### What’s Not
- Some legacy RD features are missing.
- There are still a few rough edges — expect occasional bugs.
- It’s a change, and for some users, change is hard.

## What IT Support Should Pay Attention To

If you're working a help desk role or aiming for one, here's why this matters:

- You’ll need to support users during the transition.
- Understanding how Windows 365 and AVD work under the hood will give you a serious edge.
- It’s another cloud-based tool — which means Intune, conditional access, centralized deployment — all stuff hiring managers are watching for.

## Final Take

This isn’t just a cosmetic update. Microsoft is reworking how we connect to cloud environments, and they’re making it easier for IT to manage and deploy those connections. The Windows App is going to be a big part of that.

If you haven’t played with it yet, fire it up in a lab. Learn how to use it, troubleshoot it, and maybe even write about it yourself — that kind of initiative stands out.
