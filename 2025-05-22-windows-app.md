> Microsoft is officially saying goodbye to the Remote Desktop app‚Äîand IT teams everywhere are taking notice.

## A Big Shift in Remote Access: Introducing the Windows App

On **May 27, 2025**, Microsoft will officially retire the classic **Remote Desktop (RD)** app and transition users to the newer **Windows App**. For IT admins and help desk teams, this marks a major shift in how remote work is managed‚Äîespecially in Microsoft-centric environments.

But don't panic‚Äîthis change is not just cosmetic. The Windows App brings modern features, broader service integration, and enhanced performance, particularly for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams.

## Why Microsoft is Deprecating Remote Desktop

The Remote Desktop app has been a staple for years, but it hasn‚Äôt kept up with the evolution of cloud-based work environments. Microsoft‚Äôs move is part of a broader push to unify access to:

- **Windows 365** (Cloud PCs)
- **Azure Virtual Desktop**
- **Remote Desktop Services**
- **Dev Box** (for developer environments)

Instead of maintaining multiple apps for different services, the Windows App serves as a **single, unified platform** that supports all of them.
